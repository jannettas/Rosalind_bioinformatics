Problem
The Fibonacci numbers 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,… are generated by the following simple rule

	 ⎧ Fn−1+Fn−2, n>1,
Fn = ⎨ 1,         n=1,
     ⎩ 0,         n=0.

Given: A positive integer n≤25.

Return: The value of Fn.

Fibonacci numbers
The Fibonacci numbers grow almost as fast as the powers of 2: 
for example, F30 is over a million, and F100 is already 21 digits long! 
In general, Fn≈20.694n. 
No other sequence of numbers has been studied as extensively, or applied to more fields: 
biology, demography, art, architecture, music, to name just a few. 
And, together with the powers of 2, it is computer science’s favorite sequence.

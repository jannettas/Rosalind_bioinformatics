Problem
Assume that an alphabet 𝒜 has a predetermined order; that is, we write the alphabet as a permutation 𝒜=(a1,a2,…,ak),
where a1<a2<⋯<ak. For instance, the English alphabet is organized as (A,B,…,Z).

Given two strings s and t having the same length n, we say that s precedes t in the lexicographic order 
(and write s<Lext) if the first symbol s[j] that doesn't match t[j] satisfies sj<tj in 𝒜.

Given: A collection of at most 10 symbols defining an ordered alphabet, and a positive integer n (n≤10).

Return: All strings of length n that can be formed from the alphabet, ordered lexicographically 
(use the standard order of symbols in the English alphabet).

Organizing Stringsclick to collapse
When cataloguing a collection of genetic strings, we should have an established system by which to organize them. 
The standard method is to organize strings as they would appear in a dictionary, so that "APPLE" precedes "APRON", 
which in turn comes before "ARMOR".

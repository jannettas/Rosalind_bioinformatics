Problem
Say that we have strings s=s1s2⋯sm and t=t1t2⋯tn with m<n. 
Consider the substring t′=t[1:m]. We have two cases:

If s=t′, then we set s<Lex t because s is shorter than t (e.g., APPLE<APPLET).
Otherwise, s≠t′. We define s<Lex t if s<Lex t′ and define s>Lex t if s>Lex t′ 
(e.g., APPLET<Lex ARTS because APPL<Lex ARTS).

Given: A permutation of at most 12 symbols defining an ordered alphabet 𝒜 and a positive integer n (n≤4).

Return: All strings of length at most n formed from 𝒜, ordered lexicographically. 
(Note: As in “Enumerating k-mers Lexicographically”, alphabet order is based on the order in which the symbols are given.)

Organizing Strings of Different Lengths
In “Enumerating k-mers Lexicographically”, we introduced the lexicographic order for strings of the same length constructed from some ordered underlying alphabet. 
However, our experience with dictionaries suggests that we should be able to order strings of different lengths just as easily. 
That is, we already have an intuitive sense that "APPLE" comes before "APPLET", which comes before "ARTS," and so we should be able to apply this intuition toward cataloguing genetic strings of varying lengths.

Extra Information
We can combine conditions (1) and (2) above into a single condition by adding a blank character ∅ to the beginning of our ordered alphabet. 
Then, if s is shorter than t, we simply add as many instances of ∅ as necessary to make s and t the same length.
